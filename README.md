## Hey there! My name is Raul ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ **About Me**  
I recently graduated with an M.Sc. in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence, where I specialized in machine learning, computer vision, and their applications in robotics and autonomous systems, including trains, medical devices, and cars.

ðŸš€ **What I'm Looking For**  
I'm actively seeking new challenges to grow my skills in these fields and explore related areas such as natural language processing (NLP), generative AI (GenAI), large language models (LLMs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).  

ðŸ“¬ **Get in Touch**
